# weathersimualation
project
Developed an advanced weather simulation program in Python,
modeling transitions between weather states (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy) using a Continuous-Time Markov Chain approach.
The simulation includes fixed holding times and transition probabilities, providing a realistic representation of weather changes. 
Optimized the simulation algorithm for efficiency, ensuring rapid and accurate state transitions. Successfully validated and fine-tuned transition probabilities, 
contributing to computational efficiency, and achieved stability in simulations, even with a high number of iterations, demonstrating robust code design.
